<h2>Affection</h2><hr>
<p>- Considering how dangerous black holes "appear" to be, it is very unlikely that entering one and surviving is possible as you would be spaghettified<br><br>- A black hole has to enter our solar system for it to be possible to even reach us and those chances are very, very low<br><br>- A black hole emcompassing a solar system would happen quickly beofre we even bat an eye and we wouldn't know because of its invisibilty. Black holes do have the capability of absorbing large amounts of mass at once, bu larger ones would have to be attributed to enormous solar systems.</p><hr>
<h3>What would happen during spaghettification if we are ever in that situation?</h3>
<p> Again, it is very unlikely that one would ever be in this situation. The chances of a black hole in our solar syatem is one in a trillion and you might win the lottery multiple times with greater chances than that of a black hole death. However, if you insist we will go through the steps of dying in a black hole.<br><br>- First, you would have to approach the event horizon and go past that, so the gravity of the invisible black hole can pull you in.<br><br>- During spaghettification, you will be pulled in all sorts of ways you can possible imagine in long strands as you disintegrate.<br><br>- It won't take very long before you perish because as soon as you cross the vent horizon, you will reach the singularity and perish.<br><br>- From the hypothetical perspective of someone watching another person fall into the black hole, it would seem as time is slowing down as it distorts space-time. The person falling would seem to be in regular time, but the spectator would look at the person falling slowly. </p><hr>
<h4>Last Words</h4>
<p>- Do not worry about dying by a black hole as there many other ways you will die by before a black hole even travels to our solar system. It might take millions of years for it to enter near a proximity near us and who knows if the Earth will be there. It is anyone's guess.<br><br>- If you do worry, scientists are still researching and will warn you of your death by a black hole that will never happen, right?</p>
