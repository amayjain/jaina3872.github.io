<h2>Black Hole Formation/Vocabulary</h2><hr>
<h2>How do black holes form?</h2>
<p> Step 1: The first step is to look at a star and understand that nuclear fusion processes are occuring inside the core of the star.<br><br>
Step 2: New elements are being made and energy is being released exerting pressure outwards.<br><br>Step 3: However, gravity is pushing inwards onto the star causing it to collapse. <br><br>Step 4: This process keeps on occuring until the star has reached its limit on fusions inside the core and is exhausted.<br><br> Step 5: The star then becomes a white dwarf which is the remnant of the previous star, but with much more mass densely packed into a small volume.<br><br> Step 6: Gravity is the dominat force and the core in the white dwraf cannot repel it, so it collapses on itself once again. <br><br>Step 7: This time around the core is no longer there and in its place is a region with infinite volume. </p><hr>
