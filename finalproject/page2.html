<h2>Black Hole Formation/Vocabulary</h2><hr>
<h2>How do black holes form?</h2>
<p> <u>Step 1:</u> The first step is to look at a star and understand that nuclear fusion processes are occuring inside the core of the star.<br><br>
<u>Step 2:</u> New elements are being made and energy is being released exerting pressure outwards.<br><br><u>Step 3:</u> However, gravity is pushing inwards onto the star causing it to collapse. <br><br><u>Step 4:</u> This process keeps on occuring until the star has reached its limit on fusions inside the core and is exhausted.<br><br><u>Step 5:</u> The star then becomes a white dwarf which is the remnant of the previous star, but with much more mass densely packed into a small volume.<br><br><u>Step 6:</u> Gravity is the dominant force and the core in the white dwraf cannot repel it, so it collapses on itself once again. <br><br><u>Step 7:</u> This time around the core is no longer there and in its place is a region with infinite volume. </p><hr>
  <h3>What are the different parts of a black hole?</h3>
  <p><span style="color:tomato; font-weight: bold;">Black Hole </span>- The black hole itself is a region in space where no matter can escape it as the pull of gravity is very intense.<br><br><span style="color:tomato; font-weight: bold;">Singularity </span>- This is the part in a black hole where all matter is squished down to no volume and infinite density.<br><br><span style="color:tomato; font-weight: bold;">The Event Horizon </span>- This the border around a black hole where anything past this area will automatically be pulled into the black hole. It is commonly known as the point of no return.<br><br><span style="color:tomato; font-weight: bold;">The Schwarzschild Radius </span>- This is the radius of the event horizon where the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light.<br><br><span style="color:tomato; font-weight: bold;">Accretion Disk </span>- This appears to be a cloud around the black hole composed of matter that keeps on feeding the black hole continuosly.<br><br><span style="color:tomato; font-weight: bold;">Ergosphere </span>- It is a region located just outside the blackhole that rotates space-time as the black hole's mass rotates.</p>
