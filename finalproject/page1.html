<h2>Discovery</h2><hr>

<p>- 1687: Starts with the formation of Sir Isaac Newton’s law of gravity<br><br>
- 1783: John Michell in proposed that there are objects that have an escape velocity (minimum speed needed to escape a certain gravitational force) greater than the speed of light leading to black holes<br><br>
- 1915: Prediction of black holes came from Einstein’s theory of relativity (where massive bodies in space cause a distortion in space-time due to a strong concentration of gravity)<br><br>
- 1916: Karl Schwarzchild used Einstein’s theory to generate the Schwarzchild radius which is the radius of the event horizon<br><br>
- 1935: Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar helped explain that stars can die as a white dwarf (a star that has replenished its resources/no nuclear fusion), a neutron star, or a black hole<br><br>
- 1964: Jocelyn Burnell discovered neutron stars had the densest matter in a small area
- 1964: John Wheeler came up with the term “black hole”<br><br>
- 1971: Detection of radio waves by scientists classifying Cygnus X-1 as the first object to be a black hole<br><br>
- 1994: The Hubble Space telescope categorized images of large orbiting velocities in galaxies (evidence for large masses in compact areas)<br><br>
- Radiation that is given off by the dust and gases around the event horizon of a black hole is how scientists detect them

<h3>Tools used for Discovery</h3>
<p><ul id="lt">
  <li>Visible Light Telescopes (electromagnetic radiation varies in different wavelengths)</li><br>
  <li>X-ray Telescopes (detecting x-ray waves emitted from gases)</li><br>
  <li>Dish Radio Telescopes (radio waves detect at low frequencies which can be compared to radio waves of other space objects)</li><br>
