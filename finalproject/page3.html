<h2>Proof of Black Holes</h2>
<p>Although it is not possible to detect a black hole by itslef by directly looking at it, astronomers are able to use the space objects around it to identify if there really is such a thing known as a black hole. Black Holes are invisible and not in the scope of even the most powerful telescopes, but the stars around it help charterize the phenomena behind it. Certain activities happen around black holes that differ from activity elsewhere in space providing evidence that there really are black holes. A huge amount of mass is traced from the stars around as well as wavelengths not emitted elsewhere coupled with no light being found.</p>
