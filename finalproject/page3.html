<h2>Proof of Black Holes</h2>
<p>Although it is not possible to detect a black hole by itslef by directly looking at it, astronomers are able to use the space objects around it to identify if there really is such a thing known as a black hole. Black Holes are invisible and not in the scope of even the most powerful telescopes, but the stars around it help charterize the phenomena behind it. Certain activities happen around black holes that differ from activity elsewhere in space providing evidence that there really are black holes. A huge amount of mass is traced from the stars around as well as wavelengths not emitted elsewhere coupled with no light being found. <br><br> - The Hubble Space telescope in 1994 measured a mass that was three billion times that of the sun in the M87 galaxy in a very confined space.<br><br> - This same telecope also detected ultraviolet light from hot gases around an object called Cygnus XR-1 (black hole) be emitted and fade away suggesting that the hot gases fell though and were not in their original position.<br><br>- Researchers went to examine if there were event horizons surrounding these objects in M87 by seeing how much matter faded away. If there was indeed a surface, the surrounding matter would continue to emit the same wavelengths of light, but if there was an event horizon, the light would fade out which it did.</p><hr>
<h2>Skepticism</h2>
<p>However, even with the proof, people are still skeptical about the existence of black holes bacuse they go againts many general principles. For one, black holes go against the laws of physics when the point of singularity is reached as it is just an endless volume of area. One question that keeps on arising is that if they are invisible, then they must not exist because matter has to present to be true. Another debate is on whether it can be called a black hole or just a really dense object with a strong pull of gravity. These are hard to answer as finding an actual black holie is outside are realm of exploring because they are billions of light years away from us. There is a theory out there by a physicist professor, Laura Mersini-Houghton, that states that stars lost a significant amount of their mass when they collapse from gravity and that there are only supernovas. She also states that there would not be enough mass left for singularities or event horizons, but one flaw in the theory is going against the law of conservation of mass which states that mass cannot be destroyed.   </p>
